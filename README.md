Dots
====

This is a pure CSS experiment I novelly call Dots (tested in all browsers, unfortunately only works fully in Chrome). Dots can be added and cleared by buttons on the screen, and they rotate about the y-axis. The dots are made with only CSS gradients, no images at all! 
Future work will probably include rotating dots about the x-axis and changing their colors.
